# Advent Of Code 2019
##### In Haskell.

These are my solutions to [Advent of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019/).
Almost every solutions is self contained and should be run through runhaskell or simply as `./X.hs < input.txt`. There is also a few C++ solutions, with corresponding GNU Makefiles for compilation. The goal is to write simple solutions in Haskell that are not completely unreadable. All code in this repository are full solutions and properly returns the correct answer given the right input.
